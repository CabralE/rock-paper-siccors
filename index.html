      <h2>About the Game:</h2>
      <p>
        A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has three possible outcomes: a draw, a
        win or a loss. A player who decides to play rock will beat another
        player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or "breaks
        scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"[4]), but will lose to one who
        has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a
        play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the
        same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to
        break the tie.
